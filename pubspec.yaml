# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/placeholder-logo.png
    - assets/images/user.png
    - assets/images/logo2.png
    - assets/images/logo1.png
    - assets/images/placeholder-lands.png
    - assets/images/cart.png
    - assets/images/catgory.png
    - assets/images/homeicon.png
    - assets/images/shopicon.png
    - assets/images/image1.jpg
    - assets/images/image2.jpg

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: redRoseBold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/RedRose-Bold.ttf
